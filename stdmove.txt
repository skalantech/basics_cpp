In plain C, you don’t have the std::move function like in C++. However, I can explain the purpose of std::move and how you might achieve similar behavior in C.

Understanding std::move in C++:
std::move is a C++ utility function that converts an lvalue reference into an rvalue reference. It’s used for efficient resource transfer from one object to another.
Imagine you have a large vector of integers. Using std::move, you can transfer ownership of the heap allocation without copying the underlying data1.
For primitive types like int, std::move doesn’t matter much, but it becomes crucial when dealing with dynamically allocated content.
Emulating std::move in C (without C++ features):
In plain C, you can’t directly replicate std::move, but you can achieve similar behavior by manually managing memory and pointers.
Suppose you have a custom data structure (e.g., a dynamically allocated array). To “move” it, follow these steps:
Create a new instance (destination) with the same type.
Transfer ownership of the pointer from the source to the destination.
Set the source pointer to NULL (to avoid double freeing).
Here’s a simplified example using an array of integers:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Custom type (similar to a vector)
typedef struct {
    int* data;
    size_t size;
} MyVector;

// "Move" function
void move(MyVector* dest, MyVector* src) {
    dest->data = src->data;
    dest->size = src->size;
    src->data = NULL; // Invalidate the source
}

int main() {
    MyVector source;
    source.size = 5;
    source.data = (int*)malloc(source.size * sizeof(int));

    // Initialize source data (e.g., fill with values)

    MyVector destination;
    move(&destination, &source);

    // Now 'destination' owns the data, and 'source' is invalidated

    // Clean up (free memory)
    free(destination.data);

    return 0;
}

Note that this example is simplified, and in a real-world scenario, you’d need error handling and proper memory management.
Remember that C++ provides more convenient features for move semantics, but in plain C, you’ll need to handle memory and pointers explicitly. If you have specific use cases, feel free to ask for further details!

The misconception comes from the name being std::move and not static_cast<T&&>
